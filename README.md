Code and files of the MachineQ hackathon sponsored by Comcast.

So, everyday morning you wake up and take a look at maps to get to work, school or wherever it is you wanna go, so you could save a couple of minutes. What if we told you that instead of saving a few minutes of your journey today, we could give you a couple of hours at your journey in life! What we give you is a cleaner, safer and healthier route to travel!

How we built our hack:
* A few sensors: A pollution sensor, to measure the levels of carbon di oxide and nitrous oxide in the air; a light sensor, to measure the brghtness of the road; couples with a GPS sensor to get the location
* Some prior stats: Accident and crime rates of the locality in order to get an idea of the safety of the locality.
* All the sensors are connected to a marvin board which transfers the data through LoRaWAN to the Acility NEtwork Servers
* Put the sensor data as well as the crime and accident statistics on the clearblade platform to draw inferences.
* Put green/yellow/red dots on google maps to indicate the safety and health of the route.
